The government introduces the Single Regeneration Budget (SRB), which combined twenty previously separate programmes, with its main purpose as being a catalyst for local regeneration. It was predicated on bringing in outside capital through partnerships with private developers and housing associations.

Southwark subsequently applies for funding in relation to regeneration schemes at Elephant & Castle, North Peckham estate and Bermondsey Spa.
