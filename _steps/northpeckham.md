North Peckham regeneration gets underway comprising the demolition of the North Peckham estate which was completed in 1973 and comprised 1,444 dwellings, in five-storey blocks arranged around squares. 

Four further estates will be demolished (in part or full) as part of the regeneration, which see an overall loss of 2160 council homes. It is Manson's first regeneration scheme and is delivered in conjunction with Laing, Countryside properties and a number of housing associations.
