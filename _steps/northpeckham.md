North Peckham regeneration gets underway. This was Manson's first scheme and was initiated when he became director of Regeneration in 1996. It comprises the complete demolition of the 40-acre North Peckham estate which comprised 1,444 council homes as well as four adjoining estates.

The scheme will see an overall loss of 2160 council homes, delivered in conjunction with Laing, Countryside properties and several housing associations.
