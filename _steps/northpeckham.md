North Peckham regeneration gets underway comprising the demolition of the North Peckham estate which was completed in 1973 and comprised 1,444 dwellings. 

Four adjoining estates will be demolished (in part or full) as part of this scheme which sees an overall loss of 2160 council homes, delivered in conjunction with Laing, Countryside properties and a number of housing associations.
