North Peckham was one of the Five Estates put together to get government redevelopment funds at the beginning of the 1990s. This was Southwark's first regeneration scheme,initiated in 1996 and entailed the complete demolition of the 40-acre North Peckham estate of 1,444 council homes, as well as four adjoining estates.

This left the ball back in Southwark’s court but, without anything like the resources needed to finance the major changes still felt necessary, it was forced again to play the system and seek central government funds under the rules of what was, by the mid-1990s, the new game in town – the Single Regeneration Budget (SRB).

Critically, SRB was predicated on bringing in outside capital through partnerships with private developers and housing associations.  The Peckham Partnership formed in 1994 was a consortium (comprising Southwark Council, tenant representatives, Countryside Properties plc, the Laing Group, a number of housing associations and other interested bodies) to prepare just such a bid.

The scheme will see an overall loss of 2160 council homes, delivered in conjunction with Laing, Countryside properties and several housing associations.
