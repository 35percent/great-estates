North Peckham was Southwark's first regeneration scheme, and entailed the complete demolition of the 40-acre estate of 1,444 council homes.

North Peckham was one of the so-called Five Estates put together in the early 1990's, for the purposes of securing government funds for redevelopment from the Single Regeneration Budget (SRB).  The other estates in the group were North Peckham, Sumner, Willowbrook and Gloucester Grove.  North Peckham and Sumner were demolished, Willowbrook refurbished, Gloucester Grove part refurbished, part demolished

According to the [Greater London Authority (GLA)](https://web.archive.org/web/20120713002910/http://legacy.london.gov.uk/mayor/planning_decisions/strategic_dev/dec1802/five_estates_peckham_report.rtf), 3203 homes were demolished, 2019 to be re-provided, including housing association and owner-occupied homes, _'for a more balanced tenure mix'_.  There was a net loss of 1184 dwellings, all originally council homes.
