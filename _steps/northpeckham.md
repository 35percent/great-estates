North Peckham was one of the so-called Five Estates put together to get government redevelopment funds at the beginning of the 1990s. This was Southwark's first regeneration scheme, and entailed the complete demolition of the 40-acre North Peckham estate of 1,444 council homes.  The other four estates in the programme were Gloucester Grove, Sumner, Willowbrook, Ca.

North Peckham was one of the Five Estates, grouped by Southwark Council along with North Peckham, Camden, Sumner, Willowbrook estates for the purposes of a Single Regeneration Budget grant bid.  It was notable for [defeating an attempt](https://municipaldreams.wordpress.com/2016/10/25/the-five-estates-peckham-part-iii/) to transfer its ownership outside of local council control, to a [Housing Action Trust (HAT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_action_trust), and then on to a housing association.  Along with the North Peckham estate tenants [decisively rejected the idea](https://municipaldreams.wordpress.com/2016/10/25/the-five-estates-peckham-part-iii/), in a 1988 ballot.


This left the ball back in Southwark’s court but, without anything like the resources needed to finance the major changes still felt necessary, it was forced again to play the system and seek central government funds under the rules of what was, by the mid-1990s, the new game in town – the Single Regeneration Budget (SRB).

Critically, SRB was predicated on bringing in outside capital through partnerships with private developers and housing associations.  The Peckham Partnership formed in 1994 was a consortium (comprising Southwark Council, tenant representatives, Countryside Properties plc, the Laing Group, a number of housing associations and other interested bodies) to prepare just such a bid.

The scheme will see an overall loss of 2160 council homes, delivered in conjunction with Laing, Countryside properties and several housing associations.
