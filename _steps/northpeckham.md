North Peckham regeneration is underway, comprising the complete demolition of the North Peckham estate which comprised 1,444 council homes and four adjoining estates.

The scheme will see an overall loss of 2160 council homes, delivered in conjunction with Laing, Countryside properties and several housing associations.
