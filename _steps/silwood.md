Decant starts on 200 council homes at the Silwood estate. 

_"The original buildings on the Silwood Estate are predominantly precast concrete in nature and the majority of properties suffer from a number of problems that are generally inherent in this type of construction, including lack of security (both internally and externally), noise transmission between the dwellings, poor insulation levels, dampness and condensation. There is poor estate lighting, lack of ownership of open areas and lack of identity within the larger blocks."_

_"Amenity areas suffer from a lack of ownership as well as creating anti-social behaviour issues and being felt to be unsafe by Silwood Estate residents. The removal of amenity spaces will be offset by providing most of the new dwellings with individual garden areas. Such garden areas will be arranged in a back to back formation to ensure that they are secure and that there is no easy access into these gardens or the dwellings by intruders."_
