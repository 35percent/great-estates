Decant starts on the 95 council homes on (phases 4a & 4b) Southwark's half of the Silwood estate (the estate straddles the boundary with Lewisham).

The site is handed to Notting Hill Genesis housing association, which has built 182 new homes of which 55 were approved as social rent. Again, we have [shown](http://35percent.org/redefining-social-rent/) that these 'social rented' homes have been delivered as affordable rent - i.e. up to 80% market rent.
