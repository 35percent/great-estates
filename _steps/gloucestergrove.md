Gloucester Grove estate is part demolished, part refurbished. It consisted of 1,210 flats and maisonettes distributed in 29 blocks, from three to ten storeys high; three blocks have been retained and refurbished.

Glocester Grove was one of the Five Estates, grouped by Southwark Council along with North Peckham, Camden, Sumner, Willowbrook estates for the purposes of a Single Regeneration Budget grant bid.  It was notable for [defeating an attempt](https://municipaldreams.wordpress.com/2016/10/25/the-five-estates-peckham-part-iii/) to transfer its ownership outside of local council control, to a [Housing Action Trust (HAT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_action_trust), and then on to a housing association.  Along with the North Peckham estate tenants decisively rejected the idea, in a 1988 ballot.

The number of homes on the Five Estates as a whole was reduced from 4,532 to 3,694, with 1,854 new homes built. In terms of tenure, 4,314 council homes were reduced to 2,154 council-rented, added to 915 housing association and 625 owner-occupied homes.
