Gloucester Grove estate is part demolished, part refurbished. It consisted of 1,210 flats and maisonettes distributed in 29 blocks, from three to ten storeys high; three blocks have been retained and refurbished.

Glocester Grove was one of the Five Estates, grouped by Southwark Council along with North Peckham, Camden, Sumner, Willowbrook estates for the purposes of a Single Regeneration Budget grant bid.  It was notable for [defeating an attempt](https://municipaldreams.wordpress.com/2016/10/25/the-five-estates-peckham-part-iii/) to transfer its ownership outside of local council control, to a [Housing Action Trust (HAT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_action_trust), and then on to a housing association.  Along with the North Peckham estate tenants [decisively rejected the idea](https://municipaldreams.wordpress.com/2016/10/25/the-five-estates-peckham-part-iii/), in a 1988 ballot.

According to the [Greater London Authority (GLA)](https://web.archive.org/web/20120713002910/http://legacy.london.gov.uk/mayor/planning_decisions/strategic_dev/dec1802/five_estates_peckham_report.rtf), 3203 homes were demolished, 2019 to be re-provided, including housing association and owner-occupied homes, _'for a more balanced tenure mix'_.  There was a net loss of 1184 dwellings, all originally council homes.
