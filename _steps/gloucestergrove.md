The majority of the Gloucester Grove estate is demolished as part of the north Peckham regeneration. It consisted of 1,210 flats and maisonettes distributed in 29 blocks from three to ten storeys high of which three have been retained and refurbished.

Glocester Grove was one of the Five Estates, grouped by Southwark Council along with North Peckham, Camden, Sumner, Willowbrook for the purposes of a Single Regeneration Budget grant bid.  It was notable for rejecting an attempt to transfer its ownership outside of local council control, to a [Housing Action Trust (HAT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_action_trust), and then on to a housing association.  Along with the North Peckham estate 60% of tenants rejected the idea in a 1988 ballot.
