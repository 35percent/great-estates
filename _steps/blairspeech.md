Tony Blair chooses the Aylesbury estate as the location for his inaugural speech, where he describes _"an underclass of people cut off from society's mainstream without any sense of shared purpose."_

_"Behind the statistics lie households where three generations have never had a job...There are estates where the biggest employer is the drugs industry, where all that is left of the high hopes of the post-war planners is derelict concrete."_

Blair's government commissioned the [__'Urban Task Force'__ report](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towards_an_Urban_Renaissance) on regeneration policy and subsequently introduced several new policies:

1. Decent Homes Standard
2. Stock Transfer
3. Capital Receipts Initiative - which would allow local authorities to keep receipts from the sale of public land and housing.
