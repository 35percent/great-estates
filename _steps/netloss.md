Since 1999, the borough has lost more than 13,000 council homes (see graph below) and the proportion of council housing had fallen from 60% of to [28% of housing stock](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/2683/Southwark_Housing_Key_Stats_October_v2_2015.pdf) by 2015. This is mainly the consequence of [Right to Buy](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/759390/LT_685.xlsx) and [void sales](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/561232/LT_648.xlsx).

But council estate regeneration is also playing its part. An [Estates Gazette article](http://heygate.github.io/img/EstatesGazette.pdf) of 1999 mentions three estates south of Tower Bridge, earmarked for demolition. [At least eight others](http://35percent.org/the-southwark-clearances) can be added, totalling 7,639 council homes and leasehold properties lost. The developments replacing these will provide over 11,000 new homes, but only 3,200 of them will be social rented and while Southwark does now have an council house building programme, it is [still knocking down and selling off council homes faster than it is building them](http://35percent.org/the-southwark-clearances).
