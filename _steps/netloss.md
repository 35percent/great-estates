Fred Manson, Southwark Council’s Director of Regeneration, who was close to the Blairite elite and advised on Richard Rogers’s Urban Task Force report (which contains much Southwark chapter and verse), sets out the aims of the Labour council’s new [regeneration strategy](http://heygate.github.io/img/RegenerationStrategy.pdf): _"the use of Council assets to lever in investment .. through disposals, and re-investing resources in remaining assets."_ 

Manson explains: _“We need to have a wider range of people living in the borough”_ because _“social housing generates people on low incomes coming in and that generates poor school performances, middle-class people stay away.”_  He explains that _"the policy is aimed at reversing some of the problems caused by past social engineering."_

Southwark has since seen a net loss of over 13,000 council homes. We chart how its estate regeneration policies have helped lead to this decline.
