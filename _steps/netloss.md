Tony Blair chooses the Aylesbury estate as the location for his inaugural speech, where he describes _"an underclass of people cut off from society's mainstream without any sense of shared purpose."_

_"Behind the statistics lie households where three generations have never had a job...There are estates where the biggest employer is the drugs industry, where all that is left of the high hopes of the post-war planners is derelict concrete."_

Fred Manson, Southwark Council’s Director of Regeneration, who was close to the Blairite elite and advised on Richard Rogers’s Urban Task Force report (which contains much Southwark chapter and verse), sets out the aims of the Labour council’s new [regeneration strategy](http://heygate.github.io/img/RegenerationStrategy.pdf): _"the use of Council assets to lever in investment - through disposals, and re-investing resources in remaining assets."_ 

Manson explains: _“We need to have a wider range of people living in the borough”_ because _“social housing generates people on low incomes coming in and that generates poor school performances, middle-class people stay away.”_  He explains that _"the policy is aimed at reversing some of the problems caused by past social engineering."_
