In reponse to the government's new Capital Receipts Initiative, Southwark's Housing Committee approves the 'Southwark Estates Initiative'

The 15th Dec 1998 Committee report (at Tab F1, pages 330A-345A of FVA First Tier Tribunal) said that the SEI _"will result in the Council owning a smaller and higher quality housing stock."_

(FOI request - any others related to the SEI, including the 'Southwark Housing Strategy 1998-2005'.) 

The initiative earmarked a number of council estates for full or partial redevelopment. The sales proceeds would be used to improve existing stock.
