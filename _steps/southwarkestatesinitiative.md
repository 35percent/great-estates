In reponse to the government's new Capital Receipts Initiative, Southwark's Housing Committee approves the 'Southwark Estates Initiative'

(FOI request - this committee paper and any others related to the SEI, including the 'Southwark Housing Strategy 1998-2005'.) 

The initiative earmarked a number of council estates for full or partial redevelopment. The sales proceeds would be used to improve existing stock.
