Demolition starts on Coopers Road estate, Old Kent Rd.  It comprised 196 council homes in five blocks - two 15-storey tower blocks (Yeoman Court & Marchant Court) and three lower level maisonette blocks. The final phase of the four-phase development was completed in 2015.

The estate's land was sold by Southwark to Countryside Properties and Peabody housing association for a total of Â£4.09m. They built 247 new homes of which 107 were approved as social rent. However, data from the Greater London Authority (GLA) [shows that](http://35percent.org/redefining-social-rent) have instead been delivered as affordable rent - i.e. up to 80% market rent.
