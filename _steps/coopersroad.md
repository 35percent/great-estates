Demolition starts on Coopers Road estate, which comprised 196 council homes in five blocks - two 15-storey tower blocks (Yeoman Court & Marchant Court) and three lower level maisonette blocks.

The estate was sold to Countryside Properties and Peabody housing association, which built 247 new homes of which 107 were approved as social rent. We [have shown](http://35percent.org/redefining-social-rent) that these have instead been delivered as affordable rent - i.e. up to 80% market rent.
