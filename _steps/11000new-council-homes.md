In 2014, the council made an ambitious pledge to build 11,000 new council homes, the first 1,500 of which to be completed by the end of 2018. 

But the programme, hailed as the 'largest council house building programme in the country' is way behind schedule and as of September 2019 it has only built 328. 

Over the same period 566 homes have been demolished in the latest phase of the Aylesbury estate regeneration alone.
