It is not just council estates being demolished. In 2009, Southwark's Tory/Lib Dem administration introduced a policy of selling off every council home that becomes vacant and is valued above £400,000. In 2011 this was [reviewed by the incoming Labour administration which reduced](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s19458/Report%20Review%20of%20Void%20Disposal%20Strategy.pdf) the threshold to £300,000. [Government statistics](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/561232/LT_648.xlsx) show that Southwark has sold off over a thousand council homes under this policy in the five years from 2010 to 2015. [This compilation](http://35percent.org/img/sold_by_southwark.pdf) taken from auction websites shows a sample of some of these.
