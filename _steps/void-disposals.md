It is not just council estates being demolished. Southwark has a ['void disposal policy'](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s19458/Report%20Review%20of%20Void%20Disposal%20Strategy.pdf) which means it sells of council homes that become vacant if they are valued at more than Â£400,000. [This compilation](http://35percent.org/img/sold_by_southwark.pdf) taken from auction websites shows a sample of council homes sold through this policy.
