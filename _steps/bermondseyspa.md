This scheme comprises [15 council-owned sites across a 50-acre area](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/regeneration/bermondsey-spa?chapter=3), delivered in conjunction with developer Linden Homes, Hyde housing association and Notting Hill Genesis housing association. 147 council homes have been demolished and of the [1,553 new homes constructed, 491](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s64606/Report%20Disposal%20of%20Dockley%20Road%20Business%20Estate%20Bermondsey%20Site%20N%20Bermondsey%20Spa.pdf) are approved as social rent. It has [been shown](http://35percent.org/redefining-social-rent) that at least two phases of the scheme have been delivered as affordable rent instead of social rent - i.e. up to 80% market rent.
 
The scheme [also involved demolition](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/Data/Executive/20060718/Agenda/Item%2014%20-%20Approval%20of%20Master%20Plan%20-%20Bermondsey%20Spa%20Site%20C.pdf) of several council buildings including offices that employed 640 Health & Social Care staff (Mabel Goldwin House) and a further 300 staff based at the council's Spa Road complex. Gibson House was also demolished, which ran an externalised residential service for adults with learning disabilities and a day care facility for older people with mental health problems.
