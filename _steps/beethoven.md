Tony Blair gives his inaugural speech on the Aylesbury estate where he describes _"an underclass of people cut off from society's mainstream without any sense of shared purpose."_

_"Behind the statistics lie households where three generations have never had a job...There are estates where the biggest employer is the drugs industry, where all that is left of the high hopes of the post-war planners is derelict concrete."_
