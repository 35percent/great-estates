 In her [Public Inquiry evidence](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/Catherine_Bates2.pdf), Southwark's in-house architect said that _"the condition of the buildings does not, itself present a case for demolition and redevelopment"_ but that the _"fundamental issue is the estate layout and the poor urban environment this presents"_. In paragraph 5.3 of her evidence she gives examples of this 'poor urban environment' which include criticisms that: 

 * _"The scale and orthogonal formation of the blocks (some of the longest in Europe) does not correspond to human scale, nor does it create opportunities for neighbourliness and local neighbourhood identity."_

 * _"The estate roads, which serve to access gargages, typically terminate in dead ends, and have little relationship to front doors of dwellings"_. This means that _"residents are deprived of a clear address, and identity, and experience various practical inconvenincies i.e. deliveries finding it difficult to locate front doors."_

 * _"Lack of ownership"_ of the estates green spaces, means that _"they are under used"_.

She has also gone on record saying: _"We're determined to break down the estate concept."_
