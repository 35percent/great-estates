 In her [Public Inquiry evidence](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/Catherine_Bates2.pdf), Southwark's in-house architect said that _"the condition of the buildings does not, itself present a case for demolition and redevelopment"_ but that the _"fundamental issue is the estate layout and the poor urban environment this presents"_. 

_"The scale and orthogonal formation of the blocks does not correspond to human scale, nor does it create opportunities for neighbourliness and local neighbourhood identity."_

_"We're determined to break down the estate concept."_
