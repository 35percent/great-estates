Demolition continues of the 2,758 council homes on Southwark's largest estate - the Aylesbury. The estate has been sold to Notting Hill Genesis housing association, which has been granted permission to build 3,500 new homes of which at least 631 will be 'social rented'.

In her [Public Inquiry evidence](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/Catherine_Bates2.pdf), Southwark's in-house architect said that _"the condition of the buildings does not, itself present a case for demolition and redevelopment"_ but that the _"fundamental issue is the estate layout and the poor urban environment this presents"_. 

She claims that _"the scale and orthogonal formation of the blocks does not correspond to human scale, nor does it create opportunities for neighbourliness and local neighbourhood identity"_ and is [elsewhere](https://www.building.co.uk/aylesbury-estate-taking-back-the-streets/5040143.article) quoted as saying:_"We're determined to break down the estate concept."_

In 2016, the demolition was temporary halted as the government [blocked the council's compulsory purchase order](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-37417949) on the grounds that leaseholders' human rights were being breached.
