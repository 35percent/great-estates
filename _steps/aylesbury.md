Demolition continues of the 2,758 council homes on Southwark's largest estate - the Aylesbury. The estate has been sold to two housing associations (L&Q and Notting Hill Genesis). A total of beween 2,900 and nearly 4,000 new homes are planned, with a minimum of 935 'social rented', up to a maximum of 1,323.

In 2014 Southwark's in-house architect said that in her [Public Inquiry evidence](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/Catherine_Bates2.pdf), _"the condition of the buildings does not, itself, present a case for demolition and redevelopment"_ but that the _"fundamental issue is the estate layout and the poor urban environment this presents"_. 

She claims that _"the scale and orthogonal formation of the blocks does not correspond to human scale, nor does it create opportunities for neighbourliness and local neighbourhood identity"_ and is [elsewhere](https://www.building.co.uk/aylesbury-estate-taking-back-the-streets/5040143.article) quoted as saying:_"We're determined to break down the estate concept."_

In 2016, the demolition was temporarily halted as the government [blocked the council's compulsory purchase order](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-37417949) on the grounds that leaseholders' human rights were being breached.  A further CPO was sought and granted in 2018.
