In reponse to the government’s new Capital Receipts Initiative, Southwark’s Housing Committee approves the _‘Southwark Estates Initiative’_ and earmarks a number of council estates for redevelopment, which _“will result in the Council owning a smaller and higher quality housing stock.”_

Southwark Council’s Director of Regeneration, Fred Manson, (who advised on Richard Rogers’s [Urban Task Force](http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Society/documents/2005/11/22/UTF_final_report.pdf), set up by the New abour government in the late 1990s) laid out the aims of the Labour council’s new [regeneration strategy](http://heygate.github.io/img/RegenerationStrategy.pdf): _"the use of Council assets to lever in investment .. through disposals, and re-investing resources in remaining assets."_

Mr Manson explained Southwark's regeneration thinking to the [Estates Gazzette Magazine](https://bit.ly/36OV20E): _“We need to have a wider range of people living in the borough”_ because _“social housing generates people on low incomes coming in and that generates poor school performances, middle-class people stay away.”_
