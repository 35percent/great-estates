Fred Manson, Southwark Council’s Director of Regeneration, who was close to the Blairite elite and advised on Richard Rogers’s Urban Task Force report (which contains much Southwark chapter and verse), sets out the aims of the Labour council’s new regeneration strategy: _“We need to have a wider range of people living in the borough”_ because _“social housing generates people on low incomes coming in and that generates poor school performances, middle-class people stay away.”_
