All 874 council homes of the Camden estate are demolished as part of the North Peckham regeneration.
The estate was one of the so-called 'Five Estates', combined in the early 1990's, for the purposes of securing government funds for redevelopment from the Single Regeneration Budget (SRB).  The other estates in the group, were North Peckham, Sumner, Willowbrook and Gloucester Grove.  North Peckham and Sumner were demolished; Willowbrook and Gloucester Grove were refurbished.

The regeneration was completed in 2004 at a total cost of Â£260m.  It reduced the total number of homes from 4,532 to 3,694.  4,314 council homes were replaced with 2,154 for council rent, with the addition of 915 housing association and 625 private homes.
