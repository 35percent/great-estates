Demolition starts on the Heygate estate. Council leader Peter John [described](https://web.archive.org/web/20160503113339/http://progressonline.org.uk/2016/01/14/camerons-has-much-to-learn-on-housing/) the Heygate and Aylesbury estates as _“symbols of inner-city neglect, with crime, antisocial behaviour, health inequalities and unemployment the only things that flourished there”_.

_"The layout of the site rendered the estate insular and intimidating, created problems for residents in a lack of defensible space, privacy and security and was not an effective use of the space"_.
