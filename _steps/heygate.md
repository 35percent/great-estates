Demolition starts on the Heygate estate's 1,212 council homes. Council leader Peter John [describes](https://web.archive.org/web/20160503113339/http://progressonline.org.uk/2016/01/14/camerons-has-much-to-learn-on-housing/) the Heygate and Aylesbury estates as _“symbols of inner-city neglect, with crime, antisocial behaviour, health inequalities and unemployment the only things that flourished there”_.

Many tenants were forced out with evictions and compulsory purchases for leaseholders. Empty promises of a "Right to Return" were broken, with only [82 flats for social rent out of a total of 2704](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright) new homes. Over 80% of new homes have been sold to overseas investors.
