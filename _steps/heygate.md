Demolition starts on the Heygate estate's 1,212 council homes. Council leader Peter John [describes](https://web.archive.org/web/20160503113339/http://progressonline.org.uk/2016/01/14/camerons-has-much-to-learn-on-housing/) the Heygate and Aylesbury estates as _“symbols of inner-city neglect, with crime, antisocial behaviour, health inequalities and unemployment the only things that flourished there”_.

The replacement development, Elephant Park (along with [Trafalgar Place](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!DcDunvLF2MOAcCag9FShbg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d)) will have just [100 social rented homes](http://35percent.org/2019-08-05-elephant-park-final-phase-affordable-housing/) out of a total of 2,924 new homes 

The estate was fully decanted of residents by the beginning of 2008. Council tenants were promised a "Right to Return", but the lack of social housing on the new development (now known as Elephant Park) and the passage of time rendered this pointless.  The 180 or so leaseholders had to depend on inadequate compensation to buy their new homes and many moved out of London (link).
