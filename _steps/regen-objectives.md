In June 1997, Tony Blair chose the Aylesbury estate to launch the Labour government's urban regeneration plans, where he describes _"an underclass of people cut off from society's mainstream without any sense of shared purpose."_

_"Behind the statistics lie households where three generations have never had a job...There are estates where the biggest employer is the drugs industry, where all that is left of the high hopes of the post-war planners is derelict concrete."_

His government sets out its plan for _"dealing with the legacy of large single tenure council estates"_ in a [report](http://35percent.org/img/urban-task-force-report.pdf) which, _"favours autonomous housing landlord structures, separate from strategic local authorities"_ _"diversifying tenure, income and ownership of large social housing areas."_ and proposes to _"restrict public subsidy for social housing developments of more than 25 homes to schemes where homes for rentare integrated with shared and full-ownership housing."_ and _"break the pattern of ghettoisation"_ and _"use regeneration projects to attract ‘urban pioneers’ back into city centres."_

Fred Manson, Southwark’s Director of Regeneration who advised on the report, sets out the council’s own [regeneration strategy](http://heygate.github.io/img/RegenerationStrategy.pdf), which envisages _"the use of Council assets to lever in investment - through disposals, and re-investing resources in remaining assets."_ 

Manson explains: _“We need to have a wider range of people living in the borough”_ because _“social housing generates people on low incomes coming in and that generates poor school performances, middle-class people stay away.”_  He explains _"the policy is aimed at reversing some of the problems caused by past social engineering."_
