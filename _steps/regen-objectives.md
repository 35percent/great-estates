In June 1997, Tony Blair chose the Aylesbury estate to launch the Labour government's urban regeneration plans, where he describes _"an underclass of people cut off from society's mainstream without any sense of shared purpose."_

_"Behind the statistics lie households where three generations have never had a job...There are estates where the biggest employer is the drugs industry, where all that is left of the high hopes of the post-war planners is derelict concrete."_

His government sets out its plan for _"dealing with the legacy of large single tenure council estates"_ in a [report](http://35percent.org/img/urban-task-force-report.pdf) which advocates _"diversifying tenure, income and ownership of large social housing areas"_, to _"break the pattern of ghettoisation"_ and proposes to _"use regeneration projects to attract ‘urban pioneers’ back into city centres."_

Fred Manson, Southwark’s Director of Regeneration and a member of the government working group that advised on the report, sets out the council’s own regeneration strategy: _“We need to have a wider range of people living in the borough”_ because _“social housing generates people on low incomes coming in and that generates poor school performances, middle-class people stay away.”_  He explains that _"the policy is aimed at reversing some of the problems caused by past social engineering."_
