In June 1997, Tony Blair chose the Aylesbury estate to launch the Labour government's urban regeneration plans, where he describes _"an underclass of people cut off from society's mainstream without any sense of shared purpose."_

_"Behind the statistics lie households where three generations have never had a job...There are estates where the biggest employer is the drugs industry, where all that is left of the high hopes of the post-war planners is derelict concrete."_

His government subsequently sets out a number of options for such _"difficult estates"_ in a [report](http://35percent.org/img/urban-task-force-report.pdf) which, _"favours autonomous housing landlord structures, separate from strategic local authority .. a growing separation of ownership and management issues from political intervention and leadership."_

Fred Manson, Southwark’s Director of Regeneration, who helped advise on the report, sets out the council’s own [regeneration strategy](http://heygate.github.io/img/RegenerationStrategy.pdf), which envisages _"the use of Council assets to lever in investment - through disposals, and re-investing resources in remaining assets."_ 

Manson explains: _“We need to have a wider range of people living in the borough”_ because _“social housing generates people on low incomes coming in and that generates poor school performances, middle-class people stay away.”_  He explains that _"the policy is aimed at reversing some of the problems caused by past social engineering."_
